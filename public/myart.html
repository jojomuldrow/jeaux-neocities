				<p>here's a collection of my art & anything i've managed to create with my bare hands!
					my fave art mediums are acrylic paint, colored pencils, and ballpoint pens.
					i also enjoy making clay art/jewelry, bead jewelry, and digital art. eventually, i'll learn how to sew. 
					keep in mind that these are fun, whimsical lil creations *not to be mistaken for the works of Da Vinci or Monet*.
